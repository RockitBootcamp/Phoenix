# PHP MVC - Users CRUD

The goal of this project is to create a full CRUD implementation for a `User` object using the Laravel framework.
A skeleton Laravel project has been created that has:

- all of the required routes defined in routes.php
- a UserController with all the required methods defined (but not implemented).
- a User model file that has all the required methods defined (but not implemented).
- all of the view template files, which need to be filled in.

Your job is to fill in the missing code. Most of it will be related to accessing the database.

## Basic Requirements:

- Make all the pre-existing pages work:
  - view all users
  - view user details
  - edit/update user
  - create new user
- screenshots are provided in this directory which show how the pages should be linked to each other
- NO input validation is required
- NO new files will need to be created

## Bonus Requirements

- use the input validation mechanism that is built into laravel. (Look in the ItemController or CustomerController in the POS project for example usage)
