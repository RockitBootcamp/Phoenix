# CSS Rainbow

`index.html` contains a number of `<div>`'s which comprise a rainbow, with each `<div>` being assigned a different color in `rainbow.css`. Unfortunately, the color values for the even numbered sections are missing. Complete the rainbow by filling in the missing sections using `rgb`, `rgba`, and hexadecimal values. Be sure to use each type of color value at least once, and every segment should be a different color, between the two adjoining segments.
