# Unix and Git Basics

Being able to quickly and efficiently navigate the Unix command line and git is essential to the productivity of a developer. Perform the following tasks:

- Navigate to the `/etc` folder and view its contents
- Clear your console, then navigate to your home folder using a single command and ask the instructor to verify.
- Create a folder named `new_folder` in your home directory, with a single file in it named `new_file.md`, with the contents `# Delete me`. Use nano to edit the file - not Sublime. Ask the instructor to verify.
- Delete the folder you just created, and the file within it.
- Create a folder named `projects` in your home directory, and clone the git repository for this class into it. Ask the instructor to verify.
- Using the command `man ls`, figure out the command to list all of the files in your home directory, including hidden files. Ask the instructor to verify.
