The car's direction. This could be reversed and would be just as efficient -

/*
One of the main points of this exercise is to teach the importance of
nesting IF statements as oppose to combining them. Look at our student
Sally's progress. She's on the right track but by combining the car direction
and the car's position relative to the person (all at line 59), she thinks
that the else clause is for the car going down. She has programmed herself
into a corner with no good spot for "Can't pickup person, (car already passed)"
*/

// Sally's Algo:
if (person_request == 'up') {

	if (car_direction == 'up' && car_at < person_at) {
		console.log('Pickup Person Going Up');
	} else {
		console.log('Can\'t pickup person (Car going in wrong direction)');
	}

} else if (person_request == 'down') {
	// todo soon
}


// After talking to Sally, here is her new solution which incorporates
// "car already passed":


// Sally's Algo:
if (person_request == 'up') {

	if (car_direction == 'up' && car_at < person_at) {
		console.log('Pickup Person Going Up');
	} else if (car_direction == 'up' && car_at > person_at) {
		console.log('Can\'t pickup person, (car already passed)');
	} else {
		console.log('Can\'t pickup person (Car going in wrong direction)');
	}

} else if (person_request == 'down') {
	// todo soon
}

/*
Even though her new solution technically produces the right answer, she now
has (car_direction == 'up') written twice. It's not very DRY code and if we
decide to change the string 'up' to another value, she has two places she 
needs to update. Also, she forgot to program for the situation of the car
being at the same location as the person. What a good learning lesson for Sally :)

Possible next steps for this assignment are:
1. Changing the person_request to be person_up (where it becomes a boolean)
		- This would lead to using the "!" operator more
		- We can identify patterns such as (person_up != true) and tell the
		  student that (!person_up) is probably cleanner

2. We could ask "Hey did anyone think of programming the messages to be variables"
   and therefore show them that they can do console.log(msg_person_up)

3. Imagine if we made a file that included the student's algo .js files all into
   one page. We would control the starting variables. Each student's console
   log would be preceeded by their name. When we run the script we get:
      "Mike:  Can't pickup person, (car already passed)"
      "Sally: Can't pickup person, (car already passed)"
      "Jim:   Can't pickup person, (car going in wrong direction)"
      "Jen:   Can't pickup person, (car already passed)"
    And it looks like Jim has a mistake he needs to work on

4. Imagine how much cooler and more efficient this will be when we introduce
   functions, arrays, and looping
