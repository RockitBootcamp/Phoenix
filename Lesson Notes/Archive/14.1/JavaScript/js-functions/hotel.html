		 <!-- As a person, I want to make a request to an elevator 
			so I can go up or down to a different floor.

		 Your job is to create an elevator object.
		 it should have a property for startingFloor (1,2,3);
		 it should have a property for initialDirection up/down
		 it should have a method 'makeRequest'.
		 		makeRequest takes a destination floor and direction
				the user want's to go

			makeRequest will respond with one of the options:
			["pickup-down", 
			"pickup-up", 
			"wrong-direction", 
			"already-passed"]; -->

		<script>


			var elevator = YOURCODEHERE;
			
			elevator.startingFloor = 3;
			elevator.startingDirection = "up";

			var hotel = {

				useElevator = function(elevator){

					var destination = 3;
					var direction = "up"; //"down"

					var result = elevator.makeRequest(currentFloor, direction);
				
					return ["pickup-down", 
							"pickup-up", 
							"wrong-direction", 
							"already-passed"];


				}

			}
