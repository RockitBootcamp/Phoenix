//Initial commit GA

/*
This is output of running admin.php in your browser.
It does functional testing of the class DB, by operating on a table called Weapons.
The initial state of the Weapons table is to contain 1 record,
with the following fields:
weapon_id => 2, weapon_name => club, weapon_image => images/club1.jpg
admin.php:
1. dumps the initial state of the table, then it does "CRUD"...
2. Creates a new record(aka row), with a weapon name of sword.
3. Retrieves 1 record with the weapon name of sword (For testing purposes:
	also saves the weapon_id in a variable called $sword_id.
	This is necessary in order to do the next testing step... Update the record).
4. Update the record: Update with weapon_id = $sword_id, changing the weapon name
	to an axe, & its weapon_str to 4.
5. Delete the record: deletes the weapon record where the weapon_name is 'slime'.
