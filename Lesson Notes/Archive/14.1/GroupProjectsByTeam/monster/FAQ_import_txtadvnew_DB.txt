Copying txtadvnew.out database into your local mysql database.

The file, txtadvnew.out contains the database. After doing the git pull
to retrieve this file, run these commands from a terminal window.

1. Start the mysql program:
> mysql -u root
2. Create an empty database named monster
mysql> create database monster;
3. exit mysql
mysql> exit
4. Start mysql again, but this time add some additional parameters
   to specify the database to use and the name of the file to import.
> mysql -u root monster < txtadvnew.out
5. The previous command imports the database but exits mysql.
   So restart mysql and enter some commands to show that the database was imported.
> mysql -u root
mysql> use monster;
mysql> show tables;
