Pay attention to the line near the top of the db.php file that does the connection to the database. I'm connecting to my personal database for now (at that IP address) and the username, password, and database name all happen to be 'bootcamp'. If you change these arguments, you should be able to target any database you like.

On the insert.php script, change the name to be your first name in the code. Then run the insert script in your browser

This will also be a fun experament because as all of you run this code, you should be able to see the user table start to fill up with your names. And notice how we're all connecting to the same database so the select.php script will start to populate with all of us.
