These are the two files that we played with on Wed. 5/7.

They must be installed into the document root of your webserver, which you should have a link to in your home directory called 'www'. If you don't have this link ask one of your teammates to help you create it.

form.html: simple html page with a simple form that submits a GET to test.php.

test.php: simple php-in-html php file that demonstrates some simple php concepts
