----------
* Describe Keywords
	* Backlog, UserStory, Task, Sprint, Story Points, Size, Burndown, Acceptance Criteria, Standup

Daily Standup
----------
The standup is a place where the team can come together and discuss the progress of the project. A few things to consider:

	* What did I do yesterday
	* What did I do today
	* Discuss any roadblocks

Typically a 4 hour session to plan the next sprint
* Sprint can be 2-4 weeks long
* Discuss Backlog items (User Stories, Research Tasks, Bug Fixes)
* Team sizes backlog items using a system:
	* T-Shirt (Small, Medium, Large, Extra-Large)
	* Fibbinachi (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 25, 50, 100)
* Product Owner owns the backlog
	* Set priority
	* Defines the Acceptance Criteria etc.
* Set sprint goals 
	* What backlog items to commit for the sprint
	* Ask for participants capacity (vacation, etc)
