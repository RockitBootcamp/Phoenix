# Using Google Maps with Javascript

## Two Approaches
- Use the Google Maps API directly
- Use the gmaps.js library

## Google Maps API

- main page: https://developers.google.com/maps/
- getting started with javascript: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial


## gmaps.js
The gmaps.js library provides an easier to use "wrapper" for the Google Maps API. gmaps makes many of the
common usages of Google Maps much easier to quickly implement. The webpage (below) has many examples with easy to copy/paste code snippets for getting started as well as complete API documentation.
