1. Make an array of user objects. Each user should have a name
and an ID

2. Use jQuery to make a list (<li>) of users

3. When you click on a user, retreive the user's name for the console

----------

4. Use handlebars if you weren't before

5. Switch the once was <li> HTML to now be a media object. The media
object HTML represent's the user. Write just enough css to make it
a proper media object

6. Use the "data-id" attribute instead of the "id" attribute

7. Have a "remove" link or button in the content area of the media object
alongside the name. When the remove button is clicked, console log the person's
name
