1. Make an array of house objects. Each house should have an id, city and address properties

2. Use jQuery to make a list (<li>) of houses, show only the address

3. When you click on a house, retrieve the house's city for the console

----------

4. Use handlebars templates now

5. Switch what once was <li> HTML to now be a media object. The media object HTML represent's the house. Write just enough CSS to make it a proper media object

6. Use the "data-id" attribute instead of the "id" attribute

7. Have a "remove" link or button in the content area of the media object alongside the name. When the remove button is clicked, console log the house's properties (id, address, city)
