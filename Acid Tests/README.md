# Acid Tests

## How it works

For each discipline in our curriculum, there is a set of puzzles to solve, to help you determine how well you understand the concepts.

These tests are designed to be self-administered, and as such it would be very easy to *cheat*, but you would only be hurting yourself if you do so. The goal is to attempt to apply your knowledge to these puzzles and identify areas where you struggle, so you can practice/study that area more.

> When you think you have successfully completed the tests (all are "passing" the self-assessments), please ask an Instructor to review your work.

### JavaScript

To get started, open the `solve.js` for any discipline you think you have a solid understanding of. Inside each `solve.js` will be a number of puzzles related to that curriculum. Some may challenge you to apply your knowledge in ways you weren't necessarily shown in class. Read the directions for each puzzle and solve them by updating the code. Try to solve them from memory, so you really know where you need more practice.

When you're ready to check your answers, run `npm test` from your terminal (in the `Acid Tests` directory or any subdirectory). The command will tell you if you solved all of the puzzles correctly or notâ€”pay attention to the output, as it may give you some clues as to what you did wrong.

*Good luck!* If you complete them all successfully, there will be cake :cake:

#### Running the JavaScript tests

Run all tests using the following command. This will tell you how many tests you have passed and how many are still failing.

```
npm test
```

To run only the tests for an individual discipline, `cd` to that directory and run the following command.

```
mocha
```

> :warning: Make sure Mocha is installed globally: `npm install -g mocha` to use the `mocha` command.

### HTML

Correct the mistakes in the HTML files given and use an online [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to check it.

> Please note that the validator will not be able to verify best practices, only syntax errors.

### PHP

Correct the mistales in the PHP code and check them by running the code in your browser (use your PHP server). If there are no errors, you should be good.
